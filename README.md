# electron-ffi-sample

## Run & Pack

Because We are running `ia32 dll`, you can run it only on `Windows`.

You need to node.js 8.x (LTS).

Windows

```console

$ npm i
$ npm start

```

It also executes the `electron-builder` at the same time, so the packaged application is also created in the `elect_builder_output` folder.
